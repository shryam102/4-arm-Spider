# 4-Arm-Spider-Robot
This project involves building a quadruped robot shaped like a spider, complete with 12 servo motors (3 for each arm), and controlled by an Arduino Nano. The robot offers a fun and educational experience, providing users with the ability to wirelessly control it using a mobile phone app.

## Features
* **Quadraped Spider Design:** The robot mimics the appearance and movement of a spider with its four arms, each controlled by three servo motors.
* **Arduino Nano Control:** The robot's movements are powered by an Arduino Nano, making it easy to program and customize.
* **Wireless Control:** Use a mobile phone app to control the robot wirelessly. The app is customizable using the mit-app inventor.
* **Versatile Functionalities:**
  * Move Forward/Backward, Left/Right
  * Perform Shaking hand gesture
  * Execute a fun dance step
