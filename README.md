## Features
* **Quadraped Spider Design:** The robot mimics the appearance and movement of a spider with its four arms, each controlled by three servo motors.
* **Arduino Nano Control:** The robot's movements are powered by an Arduino Nano, making it easy to program and customize.
* **Wireless Control:** Use a mobile phone app to control the robot wirelessly. The app is customizable using the mit-app inventor.
* **Versatile Functionalities:**
  * Move Forward/Backward, Left/Right
  * Perform Shaking hand gesture
  * Execute a fun dance step
## Components Used
* Arduino Nano
* 8.4V LiPo Battery
* 12 Servo Motors (3 for each arm)
* Robot Frame (can be designed self-using software like Solidworks or AutoCAD
* Bluetooth Module
* Mobile Phone
